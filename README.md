# WeatherAPI
This is the API based project used to calculate the weather conditions of different countries . 

In this project i have used OpenWeatherMap API - "https://openweathermap.org/" to move forward with . Just make you enter the country name and it will display the temperature , humidity , windspeed , etc . 
Hope you like it :)
